PHP for AWS Lambda via Serverless Framework using Symfony components for
dependency injection.

**Latest version is on [master][git-repo]**.

[AWS Lambda][aws-lambda-home] lets you run code without thinking about servers.
Right now you can author your AWS Lambda functions in several langauges
[natively][aws-lambda-langs], but not PHP. This project aims to provide a fully
featured shim for authoring your AWS Lambda functions in PHP.

More information about how this works and its performance characteristics can
be found on [my blog post][blog].

## Preview
```php
<?php

use Raines\Serverless\Context;
use Raines\Serverless\Handler;

class HelloHandler implements Handler
{
    public function handle(array $event, Context $context)
    {
        return [
            'statusCode' => 200,
            'body' => 'Hello World!',
        ];
    }
}
```

# Usage
## Prerequisites
* [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

Install this project:
```
serverless install --url https://github.com/araines/serverless-php
```

Currently `serverless install` does not work with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
Hopefully this will be [supported in the future](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/4611),
but for the moment here are your options:

1. Rebuild the PHP binary (described later in this document)
2. Download the PHP binary directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/araines/serverless-php/raw/master/php)
3. Instead of using `serverless install`, ensure you have Git LFS installed on
your system and clone the repository.

## Deploying to AWS
```
composer install -o --no-dev
serverless deploy
```

## Running locally
```
serverless invoke local -f hello
```

## Running on AWS
```
serverless invoke -f hello
```


# Rebuilding PHP Binary
The PHP binary can be built with any flags you require and at any version.

## Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Compiling
```
sh buildphp.sh
```

## Altering compile flags etc
Edit `buildphp.sh` and `dockerfile.buildphp` to alter it.
